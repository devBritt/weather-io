### Lessons
---
This challenge was the first completely full-stack project in the coding bootcamp and definitely took the most amount of work to date.
As always, it was an opportunity to practice the concepts we've been learning.
This challenge also allowed me to really establish a workflow for continuous integration and deployment.
Being able to simply push the repository to Heroku at any time made deployment testing quick and simple.
